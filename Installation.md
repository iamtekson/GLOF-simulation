# Installation of software

The installation of software is tested on Ubuntu 20.04 version but it supposed to work on any linux machine. I have used r.avaflow 2.4 version of software. The code for this version is availbe within this reposatory [here](https://github.com/iamtekson/GLOF-simulation/tree/main/code).

To install this version, you need to install the grass gis first.
